# React Router - React Project

Welcome to the **React Router** project! This application demonstrates how to implement client-side routing in a React app using **React Router**.

---

## Project Overview

The **React Router** project is a simple React-based web application that uses React Router for managing navigation between different views (pages) without requiring full page reloads. This project helps to understand how to create single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple routes and components.

---

## Features

- **React Router Setup**: Learn how to set up React Router to navigate between different pages (routes).
- **Dynamic Routing**: Demonstrate how to handle dynamic routes that depend on user input or URL parameters.
- **Navigation**: Use navigation links to move between different pages without reloading the browser.
- **Protected Routes**: Implement route protection (e.g., only logged-in users can access certain routes).
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on both mobile and desktop devices.
