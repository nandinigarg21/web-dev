## How to Run the Projects

To run any of the backend projects, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone or Download** the repository:
   - Use `git clone <repository-url>` or download the ZIP file of the project.

2. **Navigate to the respective project folder**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the folder of the project you want to run.

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
Start the project:

bash
Copy
npm start
Access the project:

Once the server is running, you can access the project on the defined port (usually http://localhost:5000 or as specified in the project documentation).

Using Postman to Test the APIs
You can use Postman to test the API endpoints for each project. Here’s how you can set it up:

Steps to Set Up Postman:
Install Postman: If you don't have Postman, download and install it from Postman’s official website.

Create a new Request:

Open Postman.

Click New to create a new request.

Set the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) based on the API endpoint you want to test.

Enter the API URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000/auth/login).

API Endpoints to Test:
1. Auth Project
